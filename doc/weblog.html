<div id="blogentry">
<div id="entrydate">18 October 2004</div>
<div id="entrytitle">Version 3.5</div>
<div id="entrybody">
This new version include the 2 following additional features
<ul>
<li>Ability to swap the phase screen during a simulation run. This comes on top of the 
"jump and reset" feature. In fact, it simply swaps (rotate) the screens every N resets 
(set this using loop.jumps2swapscreen, see the 
<a href="data-structures.html">data-structures</a> page).</li>
<li>At long last, I have figured out and implemented more realistic influence functions for
stackarray (piezostack) deformable mirrors. One can set the coupling parameter of the
influence functions. Acceptable values are from 4 to 30%.</li>
</ul>

<div id="entrydate">2 August 2004</div>
<div id="entrytitle">Version 3.3.2</div>
<div id="entrybody">
Released today version 3.3.2, that include fixes to a few bugs
<ul>
<li>	a division by zero was causing a SIGFPE for odd number of subaperture shack hartmann systems in the angle/elongation calculations in ShWfsInit (bug noted by Miska)
<li> Added a check of indices overflow when determining the Y interpolation points in getTurbPhaseInit (also suggested by Miska)
</ul>

<div id="entrytitle">YAO SSMP</div>
<div id="entrybody">
Ralf has been developing further his SSMP (Sparse Matrix Package) and a yao implementation. It looks very promising (quite faster for large systems!). Keep tuned.
<p><i>Note added August 2: Indeed Ralf has been very active. He is in the final phases of testing and has been revamping major parts of yao to be compatible with the new reconstructor choices. Reconstructors will very soon include MAP, MAP+PCG, on top of the existing SVD/least square.
Note that this will also include a sparse implementation, so it's fast !

<div id="entrytitle">Rayleigh and photometry revamp</div>
<div id="entrybody">
I've just been working on implementing the Rayleigh fratricide effect in yao.
This is an important feature in systems using multiple LGS beams with CW lasers. A WFS looking at a star may intersect the rayleigh plume from another star and thus see an increased background. This effect is particularly important to model for MCAO as CW laser is a possibility. First, I wanted to branch yao, and do a quick and dirty implementation of the Rayleigh, not planning to release it. I reconsidered after seeing that it was not going to take that much more work to actually make it user-friendly, so here we are with version 3.3. I also went ahead and implemented a clean zenith dependance. Now there is a parameter (gs.zenithangle) that sets the zenith angle (see below). Beware that the definition of photometry has slightly changed: now the zero point is for the number of photons at the entrance pupil, not anymore detected by the WFS. An way to enter the optical throughput on a WFS basis is provided (see below).

<p>Below is the excerpt of the README file relevant to this release:
<ul>
<li> semi major changes in this version. Watch out, as some parameters meaning has changed (I know this is silly, but it's more logical now).
<li>Implemented zenith dependance. Now one can change one parameter (gs.zenithangle) and everything change as needed (r0, lgs altitude
and thickness of Na layer, atm layer altitude, LGS brightness)
<li> Imlemented Rayleigh fratricide effect for multiple LGS systems!
This was quite an endeavour. I had to modify the _shwfs routine
to include several new lines and parameters relative to Rayleigh
and calibration (a side effect is that we can now do and use calibration frame in this routine). To enable Rayleigh calculations set wfs.rayleighflag to 1 (it will *not* be calculated for NGS WFS as it is assumed that you can easily block the light from the laser wavelength).
<li> The way to specify the photometry has also changed. Now, if you deal with a LGS, you specify a power and a return per watt, not anymore a magnitude (magnitude are still ok for a NGS). Also, everything -in term of zeropoints- is now specified at the entrance of the telescope: gs.zeropoint is now the number of photons for a zero mag star per sec per pupil at M1 (it used to be detected by the WFS). gs.lgsreturnperwatt is also in photons at M1. Instead, I have added a wfs.optthroughput parameter to specify the optical throughput of each WFS. Please set it, as it defaults to 1.
<li> In summary, the following keywords were added in the parfile:
<ul>
<li> gs.lgsreturnperwatt
<li> gs.zenithangle
<li> wfs.laserpower
<li> wfs.rayleighflag
<li> wfs.optthroughput
</ul>
</ul>

<div id="entrydate">07 June 2004</div>
<div id="entrytitle">CVS and bug fixes</div>
<div id="entrybody">
YAO is now under CVS. I have had Craig set up an account for me in the main Gemini CVS server (thanks Craig). This is purely for development though (only Ralf and myself have an account) and the main download is still from these pages.
<p>We are now at version 3.2.3, which fixes a few bugs:
<ul>
<li>"~/Yorick/fftw_wisdom.dat" can now be created properly under linux.
<li>I am now using convol instead of convVE for the creation of the influence functions when dm.elt=1, so this should work under linux too.
</ul>

<div id="entrydate">23 May 2004</div>
<div id="entrytitle">Update</div>
<div id="entrybody">
I have been presenting <b>yao</b> at the PSF reconstruction meeting in Victoria and several people have downloaded it.
<p>Ralf submitted many bug reports/comments. Miska pointed out a bug in CreatePhaseScreens, linked to SIGFPE being triggered by a division by zero. I did not see the problem on my G4 (I should have seen it on the G5 but did not bother going thru the phase screen creation phase there). I have patched the problem in <code>turbulence.i</code> and put the new release on the web pages.

<div id="blogentry">
<div id="entrydate">30 April 2004</div>
<div id="entrytitle">New features</div>
<div id="entrybody">In the new version 3.2.1, I have implemented sky noise and dark current, both for the SHWFS and the curvature WFS. <p>
I have added some test parfiles in the examples directory (yao/examples). New users can test their distribution by running <code>#include "test-all.i"</code> in this directory. It's relatively fast, and test various configs (SHWFS method 1 and 2, with splitted subsystem, and a CWFS case).

<div id="blogentry">
<div id="entrydate">6 April 2004</div>
<div id="entrytitle">Update of the web site, cont'd</div>
<div id="entrybody">I have now updated almost all the pages, consistent with the new structure of yao-3.0. In particular, I have updated all the install instructions, the data structures and the main page. Still to complete is the "Example and scripts" and the screenshots pages. In parallel, I am still working at completing the new package structure. Everything (include files and compiled C routines) now resides in <code>Y_SITE/contrib/yao/</code>.

<div id="blogentry">
<div id="entrydate">4 April 2004</div>
<div id="entrytitle">Update of the web site</div>
<div id="entrybody">I have updated the web site, adding new <a href="performance.html">performance results</a>, and the weblog/news (this very page).</div>
</div>

<div id="blogentry">
<div id="entrytitle">Porting to FFTW!</div>
<div id="entrybody">Done ! I have relatively painleslly ported the fast (VE) C routines to using FFTW. It is almost as fast as the apple veclib (but not quite so, so I am keeping both). This means that YAO now runs on Linux! I have installed it on heze (2.8GHz Dual Athlon) and it gives nice results, although lono (Dual 2GHz G5) with the veclib FFTs is still faster (more details in <a href="performance.html">performance</a> page).</div>
