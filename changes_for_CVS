v 4.6.1:
- fixed dpi when re-opening graphic window after fork()
- re-opening window after fork re-open in GUI drawingarea when using GUI

v 4.6.2:

- changed besseljprimezeros200.h5 in besseljprimezeros200.fits to
  suppress hdf5 dependency
- fixed unknown dpi bug in create_yao_window()

v4.7.0:
Merged a bunch of changes from Marcos van Dam. From his changelog:
1. There is a new version of soy.i. I found more bugs and since it had to be modified, I added new functions. FR: I merged these changes in soy 1.3
2. filtertilt set to 0 for interaction matrix generation. I need this to generate sparse matrices.
3. filtertilt for zernike and stackarray DMs. I need to filter tilt from DMs when doing tomography with LGSs.
4. WFS measurements set to 0 if not from same subsystem as DM.
5. minimum zernike (to exclude piston/tip/tilt if desired). I need this feature for tip-tilt tomography.
6. I remove the reporting of the number of corrected modes... do we really need this? it makes no sense for anything other than classical AO.
7. pupil (real = 0). We discussed this earlier.
8. Introduced virtual DMs needed for tomographic reconstruction
9. mmse and mmse-sparse works fine with MCAO
10. Have loop.method set to closed-loop, open-loop and pseudo open-loop. Open loop means WFS sees uncorrected WF, not corrected WF.
11. Tomographic reconstruction!
