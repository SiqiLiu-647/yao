# OBSOLETE (2007dec12)

# all these instructions assume you have yorick installed in your home
# directory. You can put it somewhere else but you'll have to review
# and change some of the instructions (indicated below)
cd

# get the latest version from cvs:
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@yorick.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/yorick checkout -r HEAD -d yorick-2.1 yorick

# install yorick:
cd yorick-2.1/
make config
edit Make.cfg and change compilation flags if you wish (I use -O2)
make && make install

# optional:
make check

# create contrib directory:
mkdir contrib
cd contrib

# get the source packages from the web:
wget http://www.maumae.net/yorick/packages/src/yutils-1.1.2-src.tgz
wget http://www.maumae.net/yorick/packages/src/imutil-0.5.2-src.tgz
wget http://www.maumae.net/yorick/packages/src/yao-4.0-src.tgz

# untar
tar zxvf yutils-1.1.2-src.tgz
tar zxvf imutil-0.5.2-src.tgz
tar zxvf yao-4.0-src.tgz

# install yutils:
cd yutils
# if you have installed yorick somewhere else, adjust path below:
~/yorick-2.1/Linux-x86_64/bin/yorick -batch makenix.i install

# install imutil:
cd ../imutil
# if you have installed yorick somewhere else, adjust path below:
~/yorick-2.1/Linux-x86_64/bin/yorick -batch make.i
make && make install

# install yao:
cd ../yao/yao_fftw/
# if you have installed yorick somewhere else, adjust path below:
~/yorick-2.1/Linux-x86_64/bin/yorick -batch make.i
make
# (ignore the warnings)
make install
# (oops, I forgot to add this in the install, do it by hand:)
cp ../*.gs ~/yorick-2.1/g/

# check everything went OK (this also create phase screens, so
# it's not really optional). Phase screens are created first,
# so as soon as a window appears, you can safely crtl-c out
# if you're bored.
make check


# now for the shiny new GUI:
cd ..
# (you should now be in contrib/yao)
export YAOTOP=`pwd`
# or setenv if you use tcsh
# you need to create the directory where yao is looking for
# phase screens:
mkdir ~/Yorick
ln -s ~/yorick-2.1/contrib/yao/examples ~/Yorick/data

# run the GUI:
~/yorick-2.1/Linux-x86_64/bin/yorick -i ../yaopy.i curvature.par
