YAO PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

Notes updated for V4.0 (2007jun03)

There are two methods of installation: from source or using the yorick package
manager (pkg_mngr). Soon to come: debian package.

1) From source:

- get the latest version from the sourceforge cvs
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@yorick.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/yorick checkout -r HEAD -d yao yorick-yao
or untar whatever yorick-yao tar file you've got.
$ untar yorick-yao.tgz
- cd yao
- follow instructions in README
- dependencies:
  - fftw3
  - if you want the fancy (but useful) GUI, you will need python, pygtk, libglade

2) Using pkg_mngr:

- start yorick
> #include "pkg_mngr.i"
> pkg_setup
> pkg_sync
> pkg_install,"yao"

- pkg_mngr does not take care of the dependencies for the GUI, hence you will
have to make sure python, pygtk and libglade are installed.

- the from-source or pkg_mngr installer puts the gui executable (yao) in Y_BIN 
(same place as the yorick executable). You'll have to create a softlink or put
Y_BIN in your path if yu want to be able to start the GUI with the command "yao"

TO RUN:

You'll have to have a parameter file (yao_par_file). Look in Y_SITE/share/yao/examples

GUI:
$ yao
or 
$yao someparfile.par
or 
$ yorick -i yaopy.i someparfile.par
to start the GUI (see above for the path definition)

Regular session:
Start a regular yorick session and type

#include "yao.i"

1) aoread,parfile
2) aoinit,disp=1  (other parameters, help,aoinit for more info)
3) aoloop,disp=1  (other parameters, help,aoloop for more info)

This preps everything. Now you can start the loop typing "go" and
pause it with "stop"
