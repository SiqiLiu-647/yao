YAO PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

Notes updated for V4.0 (2007jun03)

There are two methods of installation: from source or using the yorick package
manager (pkg_mngr). Soon to come: debian package.

1) From source:

- untar yao.tgz
- cd yao
- follow instructions in README
- dependencies:
  - fftw3
  - if you want the fancy (but useful) GUI, you will need python, pygtk, libglade

2) Using pkg_mngr:

- start yorick
> #include "pkg_mngr.i"
> pkg_setup
> pkg_sync
> pkg_install,"yao"

- pkg_mngr does not take care of the dependencies for the GUI, hence you will
have to make sure python, pygtk and libglade are installed.

TO RUN:

Start a regular yorick session and type

#include "yao.i"

- you have to have a parameter file (yao_par_file). Look in examples

- if you are running the GUI:
1) define the environment variable YAOTOP that should point to the directory
into which yaopy.i is installed
2) type
$ yorick -i yao/yaopy.i yao_par_file

- if you want to run it by hand: there are basically 3 stages:
1) aoread,parfile
2) aoinit,disp=1  (other parameters, help,aoinit for more info)
3) aoloop,disp=1  (other parameters, help,aoloop for more info)

This preps everything. Now you can start the loop typing "go" and
pause it with "stop"
